This recipe adds a developer account to the system.

    User:     developer
    Password: developer

The user is added to the sudoers configuration so that user "developer" can
access the system with root rights when needed.

To make use of this recipe, an entry for user "developer" must be added to the
passwd file used by the useradd package. This makes sure that the user is added
when the developer-account package is installed.

In case the user shall be allowed to log in remotely via ssh, make sure to
configure the ssh daemon to accept password authentication.
